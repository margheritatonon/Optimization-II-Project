## Emergency Dispatch Optimization in Manhattan

#### Context
Every second counts in an emergency. In high-density urban areas like Manhattan, determining the fastest possible route for fire trucks and ambulances is a critical optimization problem with real-world consequences. In this project, we will take on the role of a data scientist tasked with modeling and optimizing emergency response operations. Using real geographic and fire station data, we will simulate dispatch scenarios and evaluate the performance of different pathfinding algorithms.
